# üìö BookGist: Unlock the Essence of Every Book

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

**BookGist** leverages the `T5-small` pretrained model from HuggingFace Transformers to generate accurate and coherent summaries. Here's a breakdown of the process:  

1. **Text Segmentation**: The input book (in PDF format) is divided into chunks based on chapters. If the book lacks chapters, it's treated as a single chunk.  
2. **Tokenization**: Each chunk is tokenized using the `T5Tokenizer` to prepare it for the model.  
3. **Summary Generation**: The tokenized text is fed into the `T5ForConditionalGeneration` model, which generates summarized content.  
4. **Decoding**: The output tokens are decoded back into human-readable text using the `decode()` function of `T5Tokenizer`.  
5. **Compilation**: All summarized chunks are compiled into a final summary document.
